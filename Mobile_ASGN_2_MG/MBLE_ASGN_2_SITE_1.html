                After the Black Mesa Incident, while the World was exausted from fighting with the Xen Creatures, the Combine swept in and 
                conquered the planet in the 7 hour war, which indicates how long the world lasted before they surrendered. The Combine then 
                established a tyrancial rule under the former administstrator of Black Mesa, turned Administrator of Earth, Wallace Breen, 
                10 years later, and there is a significant underground resistance to the Combine. This Website seeks to describe both sides
                of this conflict as much as possible.
